1.1 INTRODUCTION

Energy lies at the heart of the economy.Energy demand or Energy consumption forecasting is crucial for policy makers to formulate efficient electricity supply policies.Energy market being a free market has a lot of manipulators who cause fluctuations in the price which in turn affects the demand.The presence of complex linear and non linear patterns makes this predictive modelling problem challenging.Demand forecasting can be broadly divided into three main categories: short-term forecasts which are usually from one hour to one week, medium forecasts which are usually from a week to a year, and long-term forecasts which are longer than a year.In this report an attempt was made to forecast energy demands at an hourly level.

2.1 CASE STUDY

Dominion Power also known as Virginia Electric and Power company (VEPCO) is the major supplier of electricity in the state of Virginia.Dominion Energy serves about 2.5 million homes and businesses or about  2/3rd of the electric customers in the state.Using the data of electricity supplied by Dominion energy in the December of 2005, which is available on kaggle repository, an attempt was made to build a model to forecast hourly energy demand.
